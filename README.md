# Tusic

A lightning-fast, Vim-driven Terminal User Interface (TUI) for streaming Music. 

Tusic strips away the bloat of modern electron apps, giving you a clean, keyboard-centric grid layout.

## Features

* **Vim-Native Navigation:** Keep your hands on the home row. Navigate panes, scroll lists, and search entirely via standard Vim keybindings (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `/`).
* **Smart "Made For You":** Analyzes your local listening history, calculates your top artists, and automatically curates a YouTube Music radio mix on startup.
* **Local Database:** Fully private, local SQLite database stores your listening history and custom saved playlists.
* **Gapless MPV Playback:** Audio is handled asynchronously via a hidden `libmpv` background process for zero-latency playback.
* **Bypass Protections:** Uses `yt-dlp` under the hood to reliably extract and resolve high-quality audio streams directly from YouTube's servers.

## Requirements

### System Dependencies
You need the `mpv` media player and 'yt-dlp' installed on your system for the audio engine to work.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/impossibleclone/tusic-go.git
   cd tusic
   ```

2. **Build the program:**
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   make build
   ```
