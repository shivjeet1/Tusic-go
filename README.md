# Tusic

A lightning-fast, Vim-driven Terminal User Interface (TUI) for streaming Music. 

Tusic strips away the bloat of modern electron apps, giving you a clean, keyboard-centric grid layout.

## Features

* **Vim-Native Navigation:** Keep your hands on the home row. Navigate panes, scroll lists, and search entirely via standard Vim keybindings (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `/`).
* **Smart "Made For You":** Analyzes your local listening history, calculates your top artists, and automatically curates a YouTube Music radio mix on startup.
* **Local Database:** Fully private, local SQLite database stores your listening history and custom saved playlists.
* **Gapless MPV Playback:** Audio is handled asynchronously via a background `mpv` IPC socket for zero-latency playback.

## Requirements

* **Go 1.21+** (To build the binary)
* **mpv** (Required: Core audio engine)

### System Dependencies
You need the `mpv` media player and 'yt-dlp' installed on your system for the audio engine to work.
